        <h2>Book exercises Chapter 11: Further Functions</h2>
        <p> Further Functions are called as High Order Funtions. </p>
        <p> I think the idea that describes the further functions is that
             they accept functions as parameters and/or returns a function.</p>

        <h2>Book exercises Chapter 13: Ajax</h2>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, 
            and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and 
            received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to 
            user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</p>
            <p>I did the receive and sending information from the book to understand better how it works</p>

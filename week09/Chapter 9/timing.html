    <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function,
         and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals. </p>

    <h2>window.setTimeout() method</h2>

    <p> The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter
        and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the following example into a console.
        It should show an alert dialog after three seconds (thatâ€™s 3000 milliseconds):</p>

        <p>The method returns an integer (171). This is an ID used to reference that particular timeout </p>
        <br>
        <p> Calling the method again and again the number that is returned is changed:</p>
